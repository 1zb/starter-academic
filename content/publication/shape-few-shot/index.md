abstract: "We propose a novel 3d shape representation for 3d shape reconstruction from a single image. Rather than predicting a shape directly, we train a network to generate a training set which will be feed into another learning algorithm to define the shape. Training data generating networks establish a link between few-shot learning and 3d shape analysis. We propose a novel meta-learning framework to jointly train the data generating network and other components. We improve upon recent work on standard benchmarks for 3d shape reconstruction, but our novel shape representation has many applications."
